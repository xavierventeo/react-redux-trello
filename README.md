# Challenge 3. Trello Clone

BootCamp FrontEnd of GeeksHub Academy

## Challenge Functional Description

```bash
Create a kanban board with simmilar functionality than Trello.

This project has implemented the features:
• Add list
• Remove list
• Add a card to a list
• Remove a card from a list
• Order cards within a list using Drag & Drop function
• Move cards between lists using Drag & Drop function

I love don't add complexity to kanban boards with too many columns and this project propose an UI to show 4 columns in large screens. 
If add more lists, the colums will be wrapped. 
The columns / list distribution is managed by responsible columns feature by Bootstrap and if you prefer you can change the configuration of columns.
